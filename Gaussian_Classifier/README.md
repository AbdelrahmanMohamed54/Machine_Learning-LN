# Multivariate Gaussian Distributions

This repository contains Python code to generate synthetic data for two classes using multivariate Gaussian distributions and visualize the data through scatter plots. The code covers three scenarios with different covariance structures to illustrate their impact on the distribution of data points.

## Task Description
The task involves generating synthetic data for two classes using multivariate Gaussian distributions and visualizing the data through scatter plots. Three scenarios are considered:
1. Both classes have the same covariance matrix.
2. Both classes have different covariance matrices.
3. Both classes have diagonal covariance matrices, but they are different.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/multivariate-gaussian-distributions.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd multivariate-gaussian-distributions
    ```

3. Run the Python script:

    ```
    python custom_4_1_multivariate_gaussians.py
    ```

4. View the scatter plots generated for each scenario:
   - Same Covariance Matrix
   - Different Covariance Matrices
   - Diagonal Covariance Matrices
